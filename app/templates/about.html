  <div class="about-right">
    <p id='about-me'> In May 2021 I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a
    B.A. in Data Science and a Domain Emphasis in Business and Industrial Analytics. During my time
    as an undergrad, I was a member the Berkeley NCAA Division 1 Baseball Data Analytics team, participated in
    Berkeley's new Data Science Discovery Program, and played on the Cal Club Baseball team, serving as the Executive
    Vice President.
    <br>
    <br>
    Since graduation, I've been spending my summer in my hometown of Pasadena, CA, where I've been
    learning about full-stack web development, working through algorithm/data structure-related questions on LeetCode,
    and preparing to start my career. I'm also an avid golfer, enjoy watching sports, and
    just recently started running and working out.
